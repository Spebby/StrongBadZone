# StrongBadZone

Final Project for CMPM 120 @ UCSC, Winter '25.

StrongBadZone is a fake game featured in the Strong Bad Email /#94 "video games",
from Homestar Runner. I have made my own version of the game featured, and have
extended it into a more complete game, based on what was shown in the episode.
